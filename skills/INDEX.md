# Skill Catalog

Standalone skills published by Skill Market live under this directory. The bootstrap `skill-market` management skills stay in `plugins/skill-market-*` so Claude and Codex can install them through their native plugin marketplaces.

This file is the remote skill catalog index. It records market entries and catalog status only. Local install/disable/update state is stored on the user's machine in `~/.skill-market/managed-skills.json`.

Catalog status values:

- `active`: available for install/update.
- `disabled`: retained in the catalog but not offered for normal install.
- `deprecated`: retained for compatibility or historical reference.
- `removed`: intentionally removed from the market; keep only when a tombstone is useful.
